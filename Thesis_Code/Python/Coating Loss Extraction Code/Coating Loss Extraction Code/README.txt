Explanation of the code:

PhiCoatExtractor asks the user for three things:

1. A coated sample loss file (temperature column 1, loss angle column 2, standard deviation column 3)
2. A substrate loss file (temperature column 1, loss angle column 2, standard deviation column 3)
3. Dilution factor for the specific mode entered by hand

The data files should be space delineated, no commas or other crazy stuff.

Note that this code only runs one mode at a time, so you will need to manually run the code once for each mode. Be happy I didn't make you do it over temperature instead :P
